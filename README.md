Public view of the computer-networks repo: My implementation of projects done as part of CS 453 Computer Networking at UMass

### **If you would like to see the code implementation/results, please get in touch with me with the methods outlined on my resume, or use the provided links on my resume. I cannot distribute this code publicly due to academic honesty guidelines**

The private repo contains the Python code of various computer networking demo projects that I completed as part of CS 453 Computer Networking at UMass during the Summer of 2024. The projects demonstrate the following:

**Project 1**:
Mock TCP/UDP client and server. This project demonstrates the creation of a TCP or UDP client/server setup where a server handles incoming communication requests from multiple potential clients using sockets.

**Project 2**:
Mock receiver/sender scenario in which we are communicating over a simulated lossy communication channel that can be configured to drop packets, corrupt packets, delayed packets, or a combination. The purpose of this project was to implement an RDP 3.0 protocol in order to facilitate reliable communication over this lossy channel.
